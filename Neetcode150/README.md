# Neetcode 150 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) problems, which are a curated list of 150 LeetCode problems covering various data structures and algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by topics:

- `arrays/`: Problems involving array manipulation
- `two_pointers/`: Two-pointer technique problems
- `sliding_window/`: Sliding window algorithm problems
- `stack/`: Stack data structure problems
- `binary_search/`: Binary search algorithm problems
- `linked_list/`: Linked list data structure problems
- `trees/`: Tree data structure problems
- `tries/`: Trie data structure problems
- `heap_priority_queue/`: Heap/Priority Queue problems
- `backtracking/`: Backtracking algorithm problems
- `graphs/`: Graph algorithm problems
- `advanced_graphs/`: Advanced graph algorithm problems
- `dynamic_programming_1d/`: 1D dynamic programming problems
- `dynamic_programming_2d/`: 2D dynamic programming problems
- `greedy/`: Greedy algorithm problems
- `intervals/`: Interval-related problems
- `math_geometry/`: Mathematical and geometric problems
- `bit_manipulation/`: Bit manipulation problems

## Progress Tracking

My current progress can be found in the [PROGRESS.md](./PROGRESS.md) file.

## How to Use

Each solution file includes:
- Problem description and link to LeetCode
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Solution explanation
- Code implementation

## Languages Used

The primary language used for solutions is Python, with occasional alternatives in:
- JavaScript
- Java
- C++

## Running the Solutions

Most solutions can be run directly with their respective language interpreters/compilers:

```bash
# For Python solutions
python solutions/arrays/two_sum.py

# For JavaScript solutions
node solutions/arrays/two_sum.js
```
