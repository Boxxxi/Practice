Problem: 42. Trapping Rain Water
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/

Difficulty: Hard

Problem Description:
You are given an array non-negative integers height which represent an elevation map. Each value `height[i]` represents the height of a bar, which has a width of 1.

Return the maximum area of water that can be trapped between the bars.

Example 1:
